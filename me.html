<h1> All About Me: Natalie Vasileff </h1>
<div class="container">

<p>
<h2> Bio: </h2>
My name is Natalie Vasileff and I am a girl who codes. I am sixteen years old and I was born in London, England. I soon moved to Moscow, Russia where my family is from and I grew up there. I came to America three years ago and began to make amazing friends in Scranton, PA. I currently live with my mom and dad and my cat, Lucia, in Darien, CT. My main hobbies include writing and reading because I want to be a journalist or work in publishing when I’m older. Writing has been my one true passion for as long as I can remember, and I’m excited to find a way to connect it with what I’m learning at Girls Who Code!
